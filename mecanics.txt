use these in the game:
std::cin.ignore();

cars:
-random number of passengers from 1-4, the higher the number of passengers, the less likely to steal it (it goes by 50% for every passenger more than 1)
1 --> x1 = (50-100%)
2 --> x2 = x1/2
3 --> x3 = x2/2 = x1/4
4 --> x4 = x3/2 = x1/8
-locked or not: 50 50 chance
-speed: from 60km/h to 120km/h (random)
-fuel: you can't refill it, and it is calculated by fuel/100km (ex: 4.4 l/100 km)

people:
-have an array with 1000 people, and randomly choose 100 indexes to be in the club
-1% of the rest are cops, that if you happen to attack, have a higher chance of killing you. The more people you kill, the higher is the % of cops in the area.
-killing people gets you money (10-100$), killing a cop gets you a glock with 14 bullets.
-cops are just an rng, no need to store their indexes somewhere, this chance increases according to diffrent towns

areas/town:
-5 areas, the top, the left, the center, the right and the bottom.
-all areas have hiding spots (behind the dumpster, a car or a store), they have a random chance of working (maybe have a luck parameter) (might remove)
-you can buy/steal weapons from the store, stealing has a random chance of working, if not, you can't enter the store anymore
-each town starts with 200 people
-distance from the center is

weapons:
-pencil: the default, deals 15 (?) dmg, breaks after 4-5 hits
-knife: 30-50 dmg
-Axe: 60-100 dmg
-gun: 9 bullets, instant kill
-nothing/hands: 10 dmg

you (struct):
-speed: a random value from (3-7km/h for walking, 24-34 km/h for running)
-you start with a pencil as a weapon
-spawn point: the center
-money: you start with 10$
-stamina: a value from 1-100, it's used in attacks (stamina + 2*damage)/3, you start with 100, and loose it when traveling or fighting
-luck: 1-100. The higher the luck, the better the range of randomness is
 ex: luck is 40, and the range of randomness of beating 1 passenger is 50-100, so the range is 50, with a 40% luck, we minimize the range by 40% (40% of 50 = 20 added to the minimum value), so the new range starts from (50+20)=70 - 100, so if the rng is less than 70 (which has 70% chance of happening), then you can get the car

 actions:
 >all actions, no order:
 -attack a civilian: you enter fighting mode, where you can:
 -hit
 -talk (first before attack?)
 -act crazy/aggressive/calm, each person has 3 parameters --> scared, trust, confused
 if just confused: the % of attack increases (surprise attack)
 if just scared: depends, if cop, the % decreases, else, it increases
 if just trust: the % increases
 Note: rewrite the equation for attack probability (luck + emotion)
 -or flee
 -go to store
 -buy
 -steal
 -steal a car
 -drive/run to a town (will use _sleep)
v = d/T
T = d/V
